Surprise, the blog is ready for action. Now it just needs some posts.<!--end-blurb-->

After a lot of tinkering, I finally have a place to store my words. This blog is part of my static website which is hosted on GitHub Pages and built automatically using Jekyll. The search bar uses [MiniSearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch) to search through posts locally in your browser. No server needed! Of course, that's not too useful yet, with there only being only one post. I also have an [RSS feed](/feed.xml) now, made following [a guide](https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/rss-feed) from Jekyll Codex. Comments are powered by [Giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus), and are stored as GitHub discussions. I probably still need to configure some stuff, but it seems pretty usable in its current state, so I will try to start putting a bit of writing up here every now and then.
