I am PureAsbestos. I make stuff (like [this website](https://github.com/PureAsbestos/pureasbestos.github.io)!). Some of the things I like to make the most include pixel art and software/games. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science, and am currently looking for work, so feel free to reach out if you like what you see.
